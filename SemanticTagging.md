# Semantic Tagging and Its Purposes #
It is a standardization which aims to make the Web understandable not only for humans but also for computers. In semantic Web, which is created by semantic tagging, data on the Web is structured and classified so that computers can also understand and analyze all the data on the Web – the content, links, and transactions between people and computers.

From a more technical point of view, Semantic Tagging or markup is just some tags in the HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) which provides meaning as well as presentation to a web page. Basically, the basic role of HTML is to be a visual interface. However, with these new concept, it also takes on clustering responsibility within the Web. The tags are easy to learn and understand and their names are self-explanatory. Following is a chart for some tags used in HTML5:

These tags are not just 'plain meaningful units’ but also adds visualization to the page at the same time. Headers, emphasis tags or lists are just some examples of it. This way, it ensures some kind of standardization in the websites in the sense that when we see a certain style for a text, we can understand it is a header or vice versa. Although, styling can be achieved just by styling commands such as `<i>` (italic) or `<b>` (bold), these efforts have no semantic meaning at all. Thus, the best practice is to use the semantic tags and apply external styling if really necessary. Following is an illustration of semantic and unsemantic HTML:

The basic purpose of semantic tagging is that it helps us, i.e, humans, with finding, identifying, sharing and combining information. So to say; if the web were to be written with semantic tags, it’ll be easier to Google something. On the machine side, it means that the computers will not need any human direction when browsing the Web, i.e. machines, as well as humans, will have the ability to ‘read’ and ‘understand’ the content on the Web, by using tags and metadata. This way, computers will understand our complex requests and respond better.


# History #

Network Model concept first mentioned as a form to represent semantically structured knowledge in the early 1960s by  Allan M. Collins, M. Rose Quillian and Elizabeth F. Roftus.
When applied in the context of the modern internet, it extends the network of hyperlinked human-readable web pages by inserting machine-readable metadata about pages and how they are related to each other.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web and director of the World Wide Web Consortium ("W3C") found the term “Semantic Web”. He defines the Semantic Web as "a web of data that can be processed directly and indirectly by machines".


# Projects #

## DbPedia ##

DBPedia is an effort to publish structured data extracted from Wikipedia: the data is published in RDF and made available on the Web for use under the GNU Free Documentation License, thus allowing Semantic Web agents to provide inferencing and advanced querying over the Wikipedia-derived dataset and facilitating interlinking, re-use and extension in other data-sources

## FOAF ##
A popular vocabulary on the semantic web is Friend of a Friend (or FOAF), which uses RDF to describe the relationships people have to other people and the "things" around them. FOAF permits intelligent agents to make sense of the thousands of connections people have with each other, their jobs and the items important to their lives; connections that may or may not be enumerated in searches using traditional web search engines. Because the connections are so vast in number, human interpretation of the information may not be the best way of analyzing them.
FOAF is an example of how the Semantic Web attempts to make use of the relationships within a social context.

## SIOC ##

The Semantically-Interlinked Online Communities project (SIOC, pronounced "shock") provides a vocabulary of terms and relationships that model web data spaces. Examples of such data spaces include, among others: discussion forums, blogs, blogrolls / feed subscriptions, mailing lists, shared bookmarks and image galleries.


# Challenges #

Though the idea is simple yet really powerful, there are big challenges to semantic web:

  1. Vastness – The information on the Web is uncountable. It contains billions of pages. The effort to tag the pages, even only the important ones, will be enormous.
  1. Vagueness – The language people use contains variations and redundancy. For example, “how much” can be used in many different ways, like asking the price, or amount or even extent. That is the reason why it is hard to teach computers how to understand vague user queries without proper context.
  1. Uncertainty – These are precise concepts with uncertain values. However, defeasible reasoning and paraconsistent reasoning are two techniques which can be used to eliminate uncertainty.
  1. Inconsistency – There are logical contradictions we generally encounter in real life.  An example of which would be to ask “which comes first the chicken or egg?” answers may vary even at the human level and there is no correct or incorrect one.
  1. Deceit – This is the place the human factor involves in. At the end of the day, the human is the one that creates the tags and s/he might be intentionally misleading the consumer of the information.


# Conclusion #

The idea of a semantic web using semantic tagging is revolutionary.When the mass and complexity of the Web is considered, the importance of this concept of classification and structure becomes clear, especially when we remember how much time and energy we wasted for finding a specific thing even when we typed ‘correct’ keywords on the search engine. Moreover, in the long run, it is also exciting to dream of the fact that ‘If we can get machines to understand humans, then we can do more with the next technology’.
