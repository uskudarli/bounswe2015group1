# Domain Analysis #

## 1. General knowledge about the domain ##

We are going to develop a software that food providers can share their food products with the nutritions in it, and consumers will be able to know the nutritions in the food they eat. It is about understanding the food we eat. Users will be able to use the software on the web or on their android phones.

Because it is hard nowadays to keep track of the nutritions we consume and it is demanded by lots of people, there are some other softwares similar to our software. Not only combining some of the properties of those softwares but also having our differences from them makes our software unique.

## 2. Customers and Users ##

There are 2 types of users in our application food providers and food consumers. Although they look separate at first but they have some common functions. For example since this is a crowdsourcing application food consumers can add recipes like providers and food providers can search,comment for a food like food consumers.

## 4. Similarities to other domains ##

The domain of our application is very similar to domains of other projects which allows users to interact with each other or companies and organizations in a broader sense. It is a social network project with a focus on food and consumer-producer relationship. Like other more general social networks, users will be able to interact with each other through our service , but the topic of communication will be on food and nutrition. It is also very similar to platforms in which you can create and share food recipes or just rate the restaurants and places to eat. However, unlike others, we don't just focus on sharing delicious recipes and superb locations to eat; we want our platform to be a hub for healthy nourishment.
Consumers will be able to find healthy food which suits their tastes and their health conditions, and producers will be able to reach their customers and give more detailed information on their products.
