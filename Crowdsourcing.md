# Crowdsourcing #

_“Crowds are a hit. Millions of people, connected by the Internet, are contributing ideas and information to projects big and small. Crowdsourcing, as it is called, is helping to solve tricky problems and providing localized information. And with the right knowledge, contributing to the crowd — and using its wisdom — is easier than ever.” -The New York Times_

## Definition ##

Crowdsourcing is the process of engaging a large group of people in order to obtain services, ideas or funds. It replaces traditional employees with a large group of individuals, usually from an online community. The basic concept is to outsource a work to a crowd of workers, and combine the efforts of numerous workers to reach the result. The word is the combination of "crowd" and "outsourcing" and originated from a blog post in June 2006 by Wired magazine author Jeff Howe accompanied to his article titled "The Rise of Outsourcing". He defined crowdsourcing as follows:

"Simply defined, crowdsourcing represents the act of a company or institution taking a function once performed by employees and outsourcing it to an undefined (and generally large) network of people in the form of an open call. This can take the form of peer-production (when the job is performed collaboratively), but is also often undertaken by sole individuals. The crucial prerequisite is the use of the open call format and the large network of potential laborers."

Crowdsourcing can take place in many places across many industries in various forms. It can involve division of labor for tedious tasks split to use crowd-based outsourcing, but it can also apply to specific requests, such as crowdfunding, a broad-based competition, and a general search for answers, solutions, or a missing person.

Crowdsourcing software development is a growing area of software engineering. Normally in a project everyone has a part assigned to it, but in software crowdsourcing all task can be assigned to anyone in the general public. Some of the benefits of software crowdsourcing are rapid acquisition, talent identification, cost reduction and solution diversity.

## Pros and Cons ##
When you look at the crowdsourcing, advantages and disadvantages just like Human nature.What I mean, you will gain endless chaos and creativity at the same time by using crowdsourcing. People will be more creative because they will feal free more than traditional ways of working on the other hand this freedoom will create chaos at some point. In order to overcome this chaos, you need perfect documentation about everything so everyone can find exactly what they want.

Crowdsourcing’s biggest benefit is the ability to receive better quality results, since several people offer their best ideas, skills, & support. Crowdsourcing allows you to select the best result from a sea of ‘best entries,’ as opposed to receiving the best entry from a single provider. Results can be delivered much quicker than traditional methods, since crowdsourcing is a form of freelancing. You can get a finished video within a month, a finished design or idea within a week, and microtasks appear within minutes.

Clear instructions are essential in crowdsourcing. You could potentially be searching through thousands of possible ideas, which can be painstaking, or even complicated, if the instructions are not clearly understood. Some forms of crowdsourcing do involve spec work, which some people are against. Quality can be difficult to judge if proper expectations are not clearly stated.
