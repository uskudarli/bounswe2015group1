Since our project is given, we gathered in ETA-A2 to discuss the project and get prepared to ask our questions to the customer.


  * We prepared about 10 questions to start the work at its finest!

  * It is decided our communicator CaglaBalcik to speak up the questions.

Then we finished our meeting to attend our first meeting with the customer!

# Attendance of our group members #

Everyone!

(Except our newly joined group member.)
