It was the first meeting with our customer. The project "We Are What We Eat" is assigned to us. We asked the questions we prepared to the customer to clarify some things to start our task.

  * All of us attended to the meeting.
  * The meeting took around 40 minutes.
  * We shared the meeting with the group 2 who is also assigned with the same project.
  * We got all our questions answered by the customer. All the answers are noted and to be posted here soon.



### The following are the responses we got from the customer: ###

  * Users can make comments on the recipes or the providers. (By this way the providers can get feedback)
  * There doesn't have to be a chat feature.
  * Providers and consumers are not mutually exclusive (Meaning that a provider can also be a consumer).
  * The comments should be able to get rated or reported.
  * A user should be logged in in order to comment or rate.
  * A mechanism to recognize the cheaters is needed.
  * Users should be able to rate a recipe according to its different aspects (e.g. spiciness, healthiness etc.)
  * The same food can be different from one provider to another according to its ingredients.
  * We should just use the written values when we give information about the packaged foods.
  * The providers and consumers can follow each other.
