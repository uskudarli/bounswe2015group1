_We gathered in ETA to get feedback about our mockups and diagrams from Can Tunca._

# We decided that; #

  * We should change our use case diagram with a better one.
  * We should fill the blank spaces in our mockups with real examples(for example in the login page we should fill the login form).
  * We should add a few new classes to our class diagram(for example Recommendation)
  * We should change the role of Can Tunca to Owner from Contributor.
  * We should add all of our content to our project main page
