Generally, I am too lazy to do anything usefull so I spend most of my time in front of computer by playing moba and mmo-rpg games and watching TV series, some times animes.<br>
I can also be  realy good at fixing problems but I need motivation to do it.<br>
Most of My codes will probably work but not efficiently so be prapare for it:)<br>
